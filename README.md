## Hi there! I fancy seeing you here... ðŸ‘‹

I am a [Research Engineer](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/research-engineers). I'm currently working on [Carbon Footprint and Environmental Sustainability](https://tracified.com/2022/10/17/sustainability-reporting-get-through-the-regulatory-red-tape-and-attract-sustainable-investments/) research area. Iâ€™m looking forword to expand my experience and knowledge in [Machine Learning and Neural network](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/machine-learning).

Here are some of the project ideas that I have worked on during my Data Science and Machine Learning journey, hope you will find inspiration:

- Commercial Certificate Verifier : Supply chain certificate verification using Large Language Models.
- Cold Chain Optimization : Harnessing the power of event tracking, data visualization and machine learning for Cold Chain management.
- Digital Product Passport : Legal stronghold of circular economy within European Union.
- AI-Driven Knowledge Navigator : AI Chat Engine for Complex JSON Querying.
- Ethereum Gas Price Optimizer : A real time data collector and forecasting algorithm to predict the probability distribution of Ethereum gas price changes.
- Navigating the Data Stream : Key considerations for a Supply Chain BI Dashboard.
- Putting an End to Greenwashing : Validating carbon footprint calculations in Public Blockchain.
- Time series count data model approach on Sri Lankan traffic accident casualties.
- Enhancing Passport Image Compliance: A convolutional neural network-based standardizer.
