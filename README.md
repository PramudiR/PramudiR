## Hi there! I fancy seeing you here... ðŸ‘‹

I am a [Research Engineer](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/research-engineers). I'm currently working on [Carbon Footprint and Environmental Sustainability](https://tracified.com/2022/10/17/sustainability-reporting-get-through-the-regulatory-red-tape-and-attract-sustainable-investments/) research area. Iâ€™m looking forword to expand my experience and knowledge in [Machine Learning and Neural network](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/machine-learning).

Here are some project ideas that I have worked on during my Data Science and Machine Learning journey, which can serve as a great starting point for your own projects:

- Built an LSTM neural network-based model with a RESTful API for forecasting Ethereum gas price changes in probabilities for the next hour.
- Conducted a survey on supply chain carbon emissions and developed a model for calculating carbon footprints, providing insights into sustainable practices.
- Analyzed spatio-temporal data of traffic accidents in Sri Lanka and developed a web solution with an insightful dashboard to understand and mitigate casualties.
- Developed an image analysis model for checking and standardizing passport/visa photos, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
- Created a machine learning model to identify factors contributing to airline passenger satisfaction, providing actionable insights for improving customer experience.
- Developed a predictive model to recognize the underlying reasons for employee attrition, helping organizations understand and address retention challenges.
- Built a prediction model to estimate app ratings on the Google Play Store, assisting developers in optimizing their app's performance and user satisfaction.
